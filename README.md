If you use this mod let me know! It's my first one and I'd love to get some feedback.

Also check out the sister mod, [Veining](https://github.com/arlyon/veining), which adds a similar enchantment to mine out entire veins at once.

## Usage

Felling is a very simple mod, and fits very well into the original feeling of the game. The mod introduces a new enchantment to the world, Felling. It can be enchanted on any axe and when chopping down trees, cuts the entire tree down at once. It is quite common (occurring about half the time with a good number of bookshelves) and works just like you would expect any other enchantment to. There are two levels:
- **Felling I** is uncommon, and will cut straight up and down, destroying all tree blocks in a vertical column. It pops up frequently with 15 bookshelves.
- **Felling II** is quite rare and will destroy all the contiguous logs. It is still relatively hard to find even with 15 bookshelves.
- **Felling III** is the rarest and will destroy all logs including diagonals. It is quite rare.

## Support / Compatibility

This mod has been tested on Minecraft 1.12.x. It may work on other versions but you'll have to test it yourself.
 
Additionally, the enchantment is compatible with any modded tool that uses the "axe" tool class, as well as all wood/leaves that are properly registered in the Ore Dictionary.

## Installation

Assuming you have Forge Mod Loader on Minecraft 1.12.x:

- Open your .minecraft folder
- Drop the jar file in your mods folder
- Start up the game
- (optionally) look at the configuration options
- ???
- Profit

When you have done this, the enchantment will be available in game. 

## Mod Packs

Feel free to use this in any mod-pack you please. I would appreciate a small mention back to this page but it's not necessary. Lastly, it would be cool if you send me a link to your pack so I can check it out!
